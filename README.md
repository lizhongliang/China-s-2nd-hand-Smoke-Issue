# China-s-2nd-hand-Smoke-Issue
The thorny issue of 2nd-hand smoke is still out of control in China after so many years. Why and how must we put an end to it?

## Best practices
* Global problems, global solutions. National problems, national solutions. It’s much wiser to come up with national solutions, instead of each local city or community trying to fix the same problem in their own ways.
* Do not reinvent the wheel.
* Focus on tackling the root causes, not the individual problems. 不要头痛医头，脚痛医脚。
## The consequences of second-hand smoke in men’s toilets
* Spreading second-hand smoke clearly violates the China’s constitution and threatens the rule of law. “第五十一条 中华人民共和国公民在行使自由和权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利。”
* For a lot of men, going to public toilets is a risky adventure. They are deprived of this basic human right in a country that claims to be ruled by law.
* Increased health risks, poorer physical and mental health, and more severe illnesses like lung cancer
* Reduced life expectancy as a result of of poorer health
* Waste of society resources to treat or alleviate medical conditions caused by this issue
* Lower birth rate or fertility rate: First, poorer health naturally leads to poorer reproductive ability and lower fertility rate. Second, people who are harmed by or hate second-hand smoke doesn’t want their offspring to suffer the same thing.
* Brain drain and wealth/capital outflow: More people will choose to flee China because of this issue.
* Lower customer satisfactory for building owners or service providers
* Lower morale of workers
* Higher vacancy rates for office buildings, shopping malls, etc.
* Poorer image for the related organization/building/community/district/city/country/nation
* Worsening inequality and higher unemployment: Fewer men dare to or willing to go out to work.
* Waste of public and private resources to tackle second-hand smoke and the chaos caused by it.
* Reduced productivity and GDP for the related organization/building/community/district/city/country/nation as a definite result of the above
## Solutions
### Ultimate solutions
* Overhaul the health care system, so that all smokers who refuse to quit smoking and are later diagnosed with diseases directly caused by smoking must pay most of the costs of treating those diseases. This will serve as an effective deterring factor.
* Totally stop producing and importing all types of tobacco products in, for example, 5 or 10 years. The damage caused by the tobacco industry far outweighs the benefit it brings.
### Temporary solution
* Invent and install effective smoke detectors and alarms in all public men’s toilets.
* Set up some negative pressure rooms inside some or most public buildings to be used by smokers only.
* Do more public education on the harm of smoking and second-hand and third-hand smoke.
* Substantially increase the penalties for violators.
## Other ideas
* Use crowdsourcing to find more and better solutions from the public. 集思广益，智慧在民间。
* Set up a special national fund, prizes or contests to tacking this issue. For instance, use the fund or prizes to encourage some startups to come up with effective and cost-effective solutions as soon as possible.
